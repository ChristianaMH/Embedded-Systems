**Problem Description** 

Our program is an assembly language program designed for the MSP430 microcontroller provided to us by Texas Instruments. On our Microcontroller, the switch2 is wired to be a pull-up resistor and set to port 2, pin 3 and the LED we wanted to turn on was led2 which was wired to be on port 6, pin 6. What our program does is that it clears port 6 within the init, and sets P6.6 to an output. Then we set P2 as input (to be used for switch 2). Then we set P2.3 to be a pull up/down resistor, selecting a pull up resistor because our switch2 is wired and set up to be a pull up resistor. Within our “main_loop” label we have two more labels, the first for checking the switch that we have set up where we check the bit value continuously and do a jnz jump to go back to the checking switch label until it's turned on to move on. Once it's moved on we enter the next label “led2_toggle” where we xor 1 for the 6th pin with port 6 (to toggle the light on). From here we jump all the way back up to “main_loop” with a jmp jump call and this repeats our main loop forever. 

All of this in conjunction achieves us with an assembly program that when loaded to the MSP430 Microcontroller we can press the button (switch2) to toggle on and off the green led (led2) on the Microcontroller. 

**Pseudocode**

    Set stack pointer to __STACK_END

    Stop watchdog timer

Setup:

    Clear Port 6 output
    
    Set Port 6.6 as output (for LED2, GREEN)
    
    Set Port 2.3 as input (for Switch2)
    
    Enable pull-up resistor on Port 2.3
    
    Select pull-up for Port 2.3
    
    Power on GPIO

Main Loop:

    Repeat forever:
    
        Check if Switch2 (Port 2.3) is pressed:
        
            If not pressed:
            
                Continue checking
                
            If pressed:
            
                Toggle LED2 (Port 6.6)
