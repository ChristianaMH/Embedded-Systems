Problem Description: For this assignment, we are building off of the fourth project and still using the LCD screen, Motor, and H bridge to send and display the output. 
However, we are using WIFI enabled ESP 32 to get input from the user as opposed to the previous 4x4 keypad. We have a website with a user interface from which we obtain a speed percentage as input from the user. We then pass this onto the MCU using a Tx -> Rx UART communication protocol where the ESP32 transmits and MCU receives. After getting the values on the MCU side we use a USCI_A1 interrupt to handle the received data and process it.  We also use Timer B interrupts to turn the motor on and off. The value put in by the user gets displayed on the LCD screen using an I2C communication protocol which is the same as we did for assignment 4. As far as the ports are concerned we used P2.0 and P2.1 for IN1 and IN2 on the H bridge, P4.6 and P4.7 for SDA and SCL on the LCD screen, and 5V and GND go into the breadboard. We also used the RXD pin on the MCU to connect to the TXD pin on ESP32.
